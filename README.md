MightyClock - a smart clock application for my pretty home server
=================================================================

Why I am building this
----------------------

For fun. It will be pretty useless. And pretty awesome, too.


What it will do
---------------

- wake me up at the specified time as listed in a text file
  - with a nice song of my choice
- show me the timetable for this day
- tell me what the weather is (so that I don't have to waste time turning my head to look through the window)
- show me any approaching deadlines
- look up bus connections that get me to school on time
  - place and time can be set to anything, and they default to school and start of my classes
- have an awesome web interface and a REST API :P

What it will do in the far future
---------------------------------

- make me breakfast - but this requires something mechanical, which is a project of its own => therefore it must be **easily extensible**
